**AdobeGenSolve** is an innovative machine learning project focused on detecting and refining hand-drawn curves in images, transforming them into symmetric and regularized forms suitable for digital artwork. The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of converting raw, hand-drawn sketches into polished, digitally refined illustrations, making it easier for artists and designers to produce high-quality visuals.

### Project Objective

The main objective of AdobeGenSolve is to create a model that can accurately identify curves in hand-drawn images and refine these curves to enhance their symmetry and regularity. This involves training the model to recognize the essential features of curves—such as angles, sides, and symmetry lines—and then applying these features to adjust the curves for a more refined appearance. The project addresses the common challenge of translating freehand sketches into digital formats that are precise and visually appealing.

### Model Architecture and Features

The model's architecture is built using TensorFlow, leveraging the VGG16 neural network model, which is known for its deep layers and strong performance in image recognition tasks. The model was trained on a dataset with an 80-20 split, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing. This split helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

To enhance the model's performance and avoid overfitting, several techniques were employed. One key technique was the use of weighted data, which helps balance the dataset and prevents the model from being biased toward certain types of curves. Additionally, early stopping was implemented to halt training once the model's performance on the validation set ceased to improve, further reducing the risk of overfitting.

Key features extracted for curve detection include angles, sides, and symmetry lines. These features play a crucial role in helping the model understand the structure of curves and how they can be adjusted to appear more symmetrical. The Python libraries used in the project include NumPy for numerical operations, OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, scikit-learn for machine learning utilities, JSON for data management, Matplotlib for visualization, CSV for data handling, Logging for tracking progress, PIL for image processing, and Flask-CORS for potential web integration.

### Progress and Future Work

AdobeGenSolve has made significant progress in detecting curves within hand-drawn images. The model can successfully identify these curves, which is a crucial first step toward achieving the project’s overarching goal. However, the task of refining and symmetrizing these detected curves is still ongoing. This refinement process will involve additional training and fine-tuning of the model to ensure that the curves not only match the original hand-drawn intent but also adhere to the desired level of symmetry and regularity.

### Conclusion

AdobeGenSolve represents a significant advancement in the intersection of machine learning and digital illustration. By automating the detection and refinement of curves, the project aims to provide a valuable tool for artists and designers, helping them bridge the gap between rough sketches and polished digital art. While the project is still in progress, with further training and refinement, AdobeGenSolve has the potential to revolutionize the way hand-drawn sketches are transformed into digital masterpieces.
